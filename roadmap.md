# Roadmap

## Ver 1 – Simply works

x Can inefficiently create a photo_mosaic (NO PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION!)

## Ver 2 – Plug & Play

x Allow pickle ingress for tiles instead of converting cropped images each time.

x Generalize program so it can be used for non-fruit-related purposes.

x Add sample image folder for plug-and-play Github code.

## Ver 3 - Algo Optimization

- Optimize efficiency of find_mosaic_tile algorithm. (Currently loops through EVERY image for EVERY TILE to find the closest match.)

## Ver 4 - Ease Of Use

- Create simple GUI https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/

- Implement command-line flags: https://typer.tiangolo.com/ (same developer as FastAPI)

- Create Frozen Binary Excecutable
